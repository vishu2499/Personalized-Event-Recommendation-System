"Sukhdev Rathod, Devi Seetharam, Ketaki Sarpotdar","The surface of Seetharam's paintings is porous and matt, concrete-like, whereas the treatment of the white fabric of the traditional garment, the mundu, takes on an appearance of chiselled marble. The dark Dravidian skin of the men stands in stark contrast. Seetharam draws upon a broad range of cultural experiences and considerations within her work. Before moving to Australia in 2016 she grew up living in China, Taiwan, Cambodia, South Africa, Singapore, Mauritius and the UAE — among other countries. These changes in physical location shaped the development of her work as she absorbed and reflected upon social constructs in multiple communities.Sarpotdar's dark, dramatic etchings and drypoints are fine-lined and richly contoured. These are master prints that are resonant with the artist’s interest in human behaviour. Exquisitely nuanced with shadow and light, they have the power to evoke our imagination. If they possess a medieval quality, it is because they are often populated by characters culled from literature or folklore.Ketaki Sarpotdar received a Diploma in Fine Art at the L.S. Raheja School, Mumbai in 2014 and a Post Diploma in Visual Art (Printmaking) at the M.S. University, Baroda in 2018. She was awarded the Jeram Patel Award for best display in the Graphic Art Department at the University, 2018, and her work has been shown at Latitude 28 Gallery, New Delhi (2020); the Lalit Kala Akademi’s 1st Print Biennale, New Delhi (2018); and the Birla Academy of Art and Culture, Kolkata (2016).","4th february,2021",Mumbai,Ocula,Arts and exhibitions,,VIshvesh,
"Aban Raza
Luggage, People and a little space","Among the many things encountered in Aban Raza's paintings and prints, there are axioms for this fragile moment in history. Much like the seams of the titular luggage, an implosion is imminent; objects of daily life strewn on tables and shelves signal a tender rootedness, as if waiting to be packed and moved elsewhere. The air is potent, nestled precariously between entangled limbs on buses and in quiet shafts of light; the air is heavy between the eyes of women and the walls of their homes; the air is limp as decay encroaches on wilting flowers—red roses to be precise, a symbol as much as an idea for the close of an era in modern Indian history.","4th february,2021",Mumbai,Ocula,Arts and exhibitions,,VIshvesh,
Black Beyond Sight,"At first glance, black may seem to cast a unifying cloak over the three bodies of works—Ahmed’s etchings on carbon paper, Shemza’s early India ink-on-muslin-on-paper works, and Thacker’s sooty sculptural scenes. Yet the three take an ‘achromatic’ approach to black, unmooring it from its either/ or relationship with light. In their hands, black is haptic: it is an accomplice to an experience that reaches beyond sight, channelling something more visceral—sonic, tactile, kinetic—than visual. The medium—ink, soot, carbon—is not simply the indexical means by which black is conveyed to a surface, but is itself wound up in the movement inherent to this achromatic black-as-activity.When Ahmed pricks the skin of carbon paper with her compass, she penetrates black as generative: her process enlists the site of blackness (rather than the mere medium of the paper) as a source, a background hum to her syncopated mark-marking. Thacker literally sets contours of her pieces ablaze, the camphor flames leaving in their wake an unpredictable black born of the elemental. Shemza’s inked abstractions and hatching-rhythmed still-lifes reinstate black to its rightful ‘thing- ness’: commuted through the tendrils of open-weave muslin, blackness emerges as freely sinuous, bristling with the dynamism that morphs into frame, fish scales, or billow.","4th february,2021",Thane,Oculius,Arts and exhibitions,,VIshvesh,
Bagh,"Mukherjee's etchings and bronze sculptures are presented together for the first time in a dialogue that probes the divide between figuration and abstraction in the artist's work. Unlike her work in fibre and clay, the bronzes never assumed a figural aspect, likely because of the unexpected transmogrifications in the process of their making. Mukherjee's etchings are also far from realistic, with a naïvete and charm that refers back to folk art, children's books, and the work of her contemporaries, for instance Bhupen Khakhar.","4th february,2021",Delhi,ZaveriDas Baatliwala,Arts and exhibitions,,VIshvesh,
Tomorrow's Land,"Vinod's oil-on-canvas paintings stem as much from intuition as from cultural circumstance. With remarkable skill, he paints powerful, lush and emotive landscapes. It is impossible to miss the absurdity embedded within these panoramas—nude figures playing football or jogging, saints playing jazz, winged figures listening to a band. Add to that, an abundance of minutely detailed motifs—airplanes made of chicken coups, advertising billboards, a statue of Mother Mary atop a tower, cowsheds with worshippers, a whale, an image of Lord Krishna.Vinod's heightened sense of colour underscores the freedom and feeling of euphoria in these paintings. Not hesitating to cite religion as an inspiration, nor shying away from critiquing the ideology of faith, Vinod Balak's Tomorrow's Land explores a collective contemporary subconscious, through a poetic register","10th february,2021",Nagpur,ZaveriDas Baatliwala,Arts and exhibitions,,VIshvesh,
A River Inside,"In A River Inside, Parekh uses liquid and its shimmering movements as metaphors for apprehending experience and describing desire. The sensuousness of water, its tendency to yield, and its forceful ability to overcome, serve to highlight acts of creation and living. Parekh's distillation of shared ideas into visual form is not a search for universals but takes personal and peculiar trajectories that are attentive to the formal balance between intricacy and restraint.This engagement with duality, and the throbbing ambiguous fissure between, much like the line or the river, is at this exhibition's core.","10th february,2021",Pune,Bhimji Gheewala,Arts and exhibitions,,VIshvesh,
New Figurations,"A preoccupation with people, more than their painterly aesthetic, starts an intriguing conversation between Matthew Krishanu and Sosa Joseph. Beyond their shared affinity for broad brushstrokes, translucent layers of colour and washed out hues is their inquisitive nature. With something of an anthropologist's eye, both Krishanu and Joseph createa visual ethnography, capturing habitual routines and profiling their subjects.

FRENETIC,"To view P.R. Satheesh's large-scale, often multi-panel paintings, is to be overwhelmed by the unbridled currents of his pigment and his heightened sense of colour. There is a fluidity and spontaneity in his application of throbbing blue-greys, acid yellows and luminous greens, the percussions of thick vermilion and chalky pink. His layered compositions suggest the play of light filtering through forest canopy and undergrowth. This is no coincidence. Satheesh's spice-farming family had moved from the plains, to the mountains in Munnar. He spent his childhood in a border zone between farm and forest, where one's life might depend on the accurate reading of signs indicating changing seasons, sudden shifts in weather, or the incursion of predators.","10th february,2021",Kota,Bhimji Gheewala,Arts and exhibitions,,VIshvesh,

Yet further looking and learning reveals definite differences. Mamtani's work remains closely visually aligned to the schematics of Mandalas; Judge's work is more open with swathes of unadorned space, it is less directive.

Six Weeks to Health Gain & Weight Loss (Live + Online),"SHARAN is happy to announce our Six Weeks to Health Gain program live online!
Reyna K Rupani tried numerous diets and exercises but her weight remained 64-65 kgs for many years.

In about 8 months, she lost over 10 kgs and in one year she weighed a healthy 48 kgs. She lost 17 kgs through a program she took up to fend off acidity!
Reyna is today a fit and self-confident mother who realised how easy it is to stay healthy by eating natural. Her 18 year old daughter cringes when someone says that they look like sisters! They even share a wardrobe now!
